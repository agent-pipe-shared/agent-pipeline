# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent Pipeline are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Versioning per [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-versioning-sha-then-semver.md): SHA-based in the early phase — the current commit on `main` is the valid, distributed state; SemVer + tags arrive once the stability phase begins.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Contribution scaffolding (CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODEOWNERS, Code of Conduct, PR/issue templates) and a GitHub Actions CI workflow running the verify gate.
- **Optional Release/Promotion SDLC phase** ([ADR-0033](docs/adr/0033-release-promotion-phase.md)): an adapter-based tail phase from merge to prod — `deploy:test` → test gate (health/smoke evidence) → `promote:prod` (human gate) → `deploy:prod` (build-once-promote) → operate check → evidence + deploy-log entry. Opt-in via a `release` section in the project manifest; zero cost when absent. Covers full test→prod, release-without-server-deploy (OSS tag/publish), and no-deploy shapes alike.
- **Deploy-precedence engine: central deploy policy vs. project manifest, as a new axis** ([ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-deploy-precedence-central-vs-project.md)): an optional central `deploy-policy.yaml` (discovered via `governance.policies_path`) with three hardness modes (`advisory`/`mandate`/`strict`), enforced primarily server-side (GitHub Environments, branch/tag protection, OIDC) with the repo guard as defense-in-depth. The deploy-policy governance layer pairs the central policy with a project-side deviation path: in `mandate` mode a project may only diverge via a valid, non-expired exception record in `docs/risks.md`; `strict` mode admits none.
- Guardrail `SEC-08` (`guardrails/security.md`): the agent never handles deploy-target credentials (cloud/registry/hosting keys) — only `{oidc, ci-secret, external}` references, never inline values; ambient git-push credentials stay untouched by this rule.
- Guardrail `GIT-08` (`guardrails/git.md`): the standing push approval does NOT cover a deploy-triggering ref — a `promote:prod`-class push to a `human-gate` environment needs its own fresh, artifact-and-environment-bound `deployApproval`.
- New deploy guide [`docs/deploy/README.md`](docs/deploy/README.md): the human-readable front door to the Release/Promotion phase — how to enable it via the manifest `release` section, its degrade shapes, and worked runs.
- New optional `release:` block in `pipeline.user.yaml`/its schema for the Release/Promotion phase configuration — zero cost when omitted.

### Changed

- License changed from MIT to Apache-2.0 for code and CC-BY-4.0 for documentation and prose.
- **Config restructure: model routing per work method (`worktypes`), dispatch tiers only in `models`.** `pipeline.user.yaml` gains a new `worktypes` block — one entry per session profile (`design`/`feature`/`mini`, i.e. design-first/advisor/speed), each with `design_phase`, `execution_phase`, and `advisor`. `models` is reduced to dispatch tiers only: `implement`, `mechanic`, the new `deep` (MP-27), and `review`. The former `models.design` (Elephant/orchestrator) and `models.advisor` keys are removed — a clean break, no prior adopters. `setup.mjs`, `pipeline.user.schema.json`, and `.claude/pipeline.yaml`'s model-routing projection are updated accordingly.

Honest maturity note: v0.2.0, a week and a half of build time, a solo project, multiple dogfooding rounds so far (this release itself was shipped under its own Release/Promotion phase) — feedback welcome.

## [0.1.0] — Initial public snapshot

First shareable snapshot of the Operating Model: role model (PO/Elephant/Goldfish/Critic), two-tier review system (deterministic gates + Critic trigger matrix), session lifecycle, handover canonicalization, project calibration layer, guardrails (`guardrails/`), model/tooling policies (`policies/`), and the `pipeline-core` plugin (git-guard union hook, skills, agents). Details: [`docs/operating-model.md`](docs/operating-model.md).

Honest maturity note: v0.1.0, about a week of build time, a solo project, one dogfooding round so far — feedback welcome.
