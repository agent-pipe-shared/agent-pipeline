## Current handover — sprint_agy fetch, fast-forward, and clean local candidate (2026-08-26)

**READ THIS FIRST — 2026-08-26 session.** PO instruction: fetch the newest
Nova state from `origin` branch `sprint_agy` (same remote,
`agent-pipe-shared/agent-pipeline` — already registered as both `origin`
and `upstream`; not a separate/third-party remote) into this checkout and
build a clean local candidate. `git merge-base feat/sprint-nova-codex-v046
origin/sprint_agy` equaled this branch's exact prior tip (`0d5a6e6b`), so
`origin/sprint_agy` was a strict fast-forward descendant, not a divergent
branch — no merge conflicts, nothing to reconcile by hand. Fast-forwarded
cleanly (`git merge --ff-only`), 271 commits, bringing in the full
tri-runner Antigravity/Agy integration (ADR-0067, `specs/sprint-agy-runner/`,
`plugins/pipeline-core/hooks/antigravity-*`, `install-agy.mjs`,
`pipeline.user.yaml` schema bump) plus the 2026-08-19→2026-08-26 backlog
history already summarized in the prior handover section below.

**Local plugin refresh was required before bootstrap would go ready again**
(`docs/claude-local-plugin-development.md`'s documented, deliberately
operator-only step): the fetch bumped `plugins/pipeline-core`'s schema/
manifest past what the session's enforcing local-marketplace copy
(`~/agent-pipeline-local-marketplace`, stale since the 2026-08-19 stamp)
recognized (`pipeline.user.yaml is not a valid V3 source`,
`project-onboarding-v3.mjs plan-source-recovery` returned `unrepairable`
with no agent-executable `nextAction`). The PO ran the prescribed
`cp -a .../plugins/pipeline-core ~/agent-pipeline-local-marketplace/plugins/`
+ `claude plugin update pipeline-core@agent-pipeline-local --scope user`
+ `/reload-plugins` themselves (this is intentionally not agent-executable —
GUARD-CROSS-REPO-MUTATION refuses a session writing into its own enforcing
plugin root); bootstrap was green again immediately after.

**First full Verify on the fetched tip found one genuine, pre-existing gap
— not a merge artifact, not a new regression.** `origin/sprint_agy`'s own
tip carried two 2026-08-26 `docs(backlog): record ...` filing commits
(`2b68ec79`, `1ebec15f`, for
`existing-repos-drift-on-agy-pipeline-user-yaml-update-no-migration` and
`push-approval-record-always-trails-the-signed-commit`) with no
`chore(backlog): reconcile ledger` follow-up — the pattern every other
filing commit in that branch's own history paired one-for-one. Confirmed
via `reconcile-backlog-ledger.mjs` (plan mode: "Would record 2
transition(s)"), fixed via the sanctioned writer (`--activate`), committed
separately (`75de5950`, `chore(backlog): reconcile ledger for the two
2026-08-26 filing commits`). Note for whoever next fetches from
`sprint_agy`: if this branch continues, watch for the same
filing-without-reconciliation gap at its new tip.

**Candidate stamped and independently reverified clean twice.** Both
runner manifests bumped to `0.6.0+{claude,codex}.20260826182242.75de595`
(commit `3268fcd8`) — the Antigravity manifest
(`plugins/pipeline-core/plugin.json`, `0.6.0+20260825.bbee2df4`) was left
as-is: the documented local-candidate stamp convention
(`docs/claude-local-plugin-development.md`) only names the Claude/Codex
manifests, and Verify already passed clean without touching it. **Full
Verify: 385/385 suites, exit 0, twice** (once directly after the ledger
fix, once again after the manifest stamp) — no known/accepted exceptions
outstanding this time (the prior `human-guard-override-tests`
marketplace-mirror exception from the 2026-08-19 handover did not recur).
Confirmed genuinely parallel: the bounded async worker pool
(`AGY-VERIFYTUNER-1/2`, default concurrency 8) ran the 385-suite set in
~2m17s, with multiple suites' `startedAt` timestamps within ~500ms of each
other before any had completed.

**Not yet done:** this candidate has not been pushed, and no push-approval
ceremony has started. No Critic review has been dispatched against the
`0d5a6e6b..3268fcd8` range (271 fetched commits + the ledger-reconciliation
and manifest-stamp commits made in this session). Whether/when to push,
and whether this range needs its own Critic gate given it was authored in
another session/branch, is a PO decision not yet asked.

## Operational head

- Project calibration: [`project/pipeline.json`](../project/pipeline.json).
- Required gate: `node harness/scripts/verify.mjs`.
- Formal decisions: [`docs/adr/README.md`](adr/README.md); no state-local
  override is active.
- No reusable full-bootstrap receipt is stored publicly; run the full
  bootstrap. Machine-local installation details and private receipts are not
  versioned here.
- Active Sentinel authority and retention are governed by
  `governance/spec-retention.json` and the linked recovery package; no
  completion or go-live claim is made by this handover.
- For this task, Nova B is explicitly out of scope.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-25 — chat-gate-ceremony standardization
(`enforce-kickoff-po-questions`, PO decision: standardize push/kickoff/
PRD-Spec approval onto ONE mechanism, `plugins/pipeline-core/lib/
chat-gate-ceremony.mjs`). Landed and independently reverified this session:
(A) push self-approval fix (closed), (B) kickoff `--language`/`--profile`
gate (closed), (C) PRD/Spec acknowledgement gate (`po-authority-
acknowledge-apply` now requires the ceremony, commits `01b10848`
cherry-picked + `550b21d7`), push-approval preference now confirmed
per-repository pre-filled from the machine default instead of asked once
and never applied (closed, commit `cefd5dcb`). GWM kernel-closure gap for
`chat-gate-ceremony.mjs` fixed (`f6c9800a`). **HGO's `authorize --activate`
chat-mode path now DONE** (`AGY-HGOFIX-2`, commit `69d608fe`,
independently reverified 76/76): `authorizeHumanGuardOverride()` requires
the attended-chat-gate confirmation in chat mode, unchanged in signature
mode. Its own collateral regression (3 dependent test files calling the
now-gated function in chat mode without the seam) was chased down:
`guard-lifecycle-ready.test.mjs` fixed (`AGY-HGOFIX-3`, commit `60805fab`,
127/127). **Still open:** `guard-gate-strength.test.mjs` (4 tests,
GST21/25/26/27) and `guard-testpath-override.test.mjs` (4 tests,
OT10/11/12/13) stay regressed — both are empirically confirmed TP-6/TP-7
guard-protected test paths with no in-session override route
(`status=author-repair-required`); fixing them needs a human-run
author-repair ceremony or a follow-up dispatch scoped with that authority.
GWM itself has no chat-mode activation path yet (barely started, reverted,
not picked back up — not blocking anything currently in flight).
**Live incident this session, recovered, filed:**
`isolation: "worktree"` (Agent tool) never actually created a separate
worktree — three parallel dispatches raced on the shared checkout, causing
three zero-commit truncations and a detached-HEAD incident (a self-heal
step ran `git checkout --detach` against the shared tree). No work lost;
recovered by hand (cherry-pick + selective revert). See backlog:
`2026-08-25-workflow-tool-isolation-worktree-never-created-a-worktree-this-session.md`.
**Until that's resolved, dispatch serially in this repo, not via
`isolation: "worktree"`.** Also filed this session: a confirmed, reproduced
`guard-dispatch.mjs` fail-open on the Antigravity `Subagents`/`TypeName`/
`Prompt` payload shape (live defect, not theoretical); a GWM
kernel-doc/code enumeration drift (13 undocumented entries); a general
"guards are tool-level, not OS-level sandboxing" idea (Nova B, deferred).
**Correction/narrower finding after further testing:** the broken mechanism
was specifically the Agent tool's own `isolation: "worktree"` parameter —
the **Workflow tool**'s `agent()` `opts.isolation: 'worktree'` DOES create
real separate worktrees (confirmed live via `git worktree list` showing
distinct `.claude/worktrees/wf_*` entries), matching
`workflow-dispatch.md`'s own documented live-tested behavior. Prefer the
Workflow tool for any future worktree-isolated parallel dispatch in this
repo; the Agent-tool-direct path stays suspect until separately verified.

**AFK backlog sweep — COMPLETE and reconciled (PO directive, chat,
2026-08-25).** `codex-runner-has-no-real-support-on-native-windows` closed
separately first (won't-fix, PO: no Windows daemon exists, existing
mitigation suffices). The 17-item Workflow-tool sweep (Run ID
`wf_3ec6e465-da5`) landed; 8 of 17 agents failed to call `StructuredOutput`
(harness-level truncation) but several still committed real work in their
worktree — every one of the 17 worktrees was individually checked via
`git worktree list`/diff, not just the returned JSON, per
`workflow-dispatch.md`'s "never trust a returned result alone" rule.
Reconciled onto `sprint_agy`: **6 fixes cherry-picked and independently
re-verified** (own test suite run directly, not the dispatch's self-report)
— a real Antigravity `Subagents`-payload dispatch-guard bypass fix (15/15,
matches the live-reproduced finding from earlier this session), the GWM
kernel-doc/code enumeration drift (13 missing entries, 3/3 incl. new
GMWKC03 regression guard), a `backlog-strip-for-dispatch` section-dropping
bug fix (12/12), a `verify.mjs` Tier-B promotion for two more suites
(35/35), a goldfish/critic template hardening against silent turn-end
abandonment (the exact `long-dispatches-truncate` failure mode this same
sweep run itself hit for 8/17 agents — 4/4+36/36), and the missing
`intake-generate`/`bootstrap-bind` coordinator skill-reference doc. Plus 6
Triage-only re-triage/correction notes (stale-claim corrections, evidence
re-checks) and one doc-only workflow-dispatch policy addition. Closed with
fresh evidence: `orchestrator-authored-production-commits-have-no-
deterministic-control` (GIT-01/GG-22 confirmed live, 230/230; its
undelivered Part B split into its own item,
`2026-08-25-verify-range-mode-registration-for-orchestrator-commit-
control.md`), `guard-dispatch-fails-open-on-the-antigravity-subagents-
payload-shape`, `gwm-kernel-doc-enumeration-diverges-from-the-code-array`.
**One post-merge regression caught and fixed on the integrated tree**
(not present in any individual worktree): the new
`docs/human-authorization-inventory.md` doc was unclassified in
`governance/observation-doc-governance.json`'s inventory, tripping
`check-doc-contracts.test.mjs`'s observation-governance pass
(`OG-DOC-UNCLASSIFIED`) — fixed, 36/36 green (`02014041`). **Confirmed
still blocked, re-verified live rather than trusted from inheritance:**
`mp22-orchestrator-self-implementation-has-no-enforcement` (Sprint Alfred),
`regulated-document-hooks` (Sprint Phoenix HAW-E batch),
`session-keep-awake` + `afk-assumption-mode` (both bound to the Nova A
candidate freeze), `kickoff-promotion-cleanup-readback` (needs a dedicated
authorized pass touching `human-guard-override.mjs`/
`codex-pretool-guard.mjs`), `scratch-cleanup-mechanism` (points 1 and 3
remain genuinely open). Backlog ledger reconciled (`6d62f964`); security
scan and `check-backlog-state.mjs` both clean on the final tree; all 17
sweep worktrees removed. 25 commits landed this reconciliation pass.

**Pushed, 2026-08-26.** The two remaining chat-gate regressions from
`AGY-HGOFIX-2` are now closed. TP-6 (`guard-gate-strength.test.mjs`) and
TP-7 (`guard-testpath-override.test.mjs`) are Pipeline plugin source with
NO in-session override route at all — `pipeline-author-repair` mode is
structurally unreachable in this repo's self-application topology
(`plugins/pipeline-core` has no independent git toplevel of its own,
confirmed live); `repair-map.mjs` itself reports `command: (none)` for
`HGO-AUTHOR-ROOT-REQUIRED`. The PO applied the same `dependencies` seam
directly in their own terminal, outside this session, via a script this
session prepared with pre/post verification (`6f073ecf`); independently
re-verified here (36/36, 19/19, plus 76/76 and 127/127 no-regression
checks). A full `verify.mjs` run ahead of the push then caught a FOURTH,
previously-unflagged chat-gate regression the two prior dispatches never
covered: `codex-pretool-guard.test.mjs` (2 failures) arms its capability
via a real detached subprocess spawn of `guard-human-override.mjs`, which
can never satisfy an attended-terminal check by design — fixed by calling
the CLI's exported `main()` in-process instead, injecting the identical
test-only seam (`1a2dbb0a`). Also found and fixed: the machine-scoped
`poKeyDirectory` (`~/.agent-pipeline/machine.json`, outside repo scope)
still pointed at a stale key directory from 2026-08-10 that no longer
matches the pinned trust anchor — the code deliberately refuses to
auto-overwrite this once set (by design, prevents silent key-directory
swaps), so it needed explicit PO confirmation, given, then corrected by
hand. Full `verify.mjs` 385/385 green, security scan clean, push-prepare
fully green, PO signed via `authorize-critical` in their own terminal.
Pushed `origin/sprint_agy`: `2887e774..1a2dbb0a` (214 commits,
fast-forward). `pipeline-state.mjs approve-push` recorded the approval
before the push ran.
