# Doc reconciliation record

This file is the input `harness/scripts/check-doc-reconciliation.mjs` reads to
decide whether every ADR implicated by a checked commit range has been looked
at. It carries no narrative; it is a machine-parsed ledger.

**Format.** A section heading is `## Candidate <40-hex-sha>`, optionally
followed by more text on the same line (a date, a one-line description). Its
body runs until the next `## ` heading or end of file. Inside that body, a
reconciliation line for ADR-NNNN is one of exactly two shapes:

- `- ADR-NNNN: checked, no change needed.`
- `- ADR-NNNN: amended in <commit>.`

A `- ADR-NNNN: ...` line that matches neither shape is reported as
MALFORMED-RECORD-ENTRY and does not satisfy the ADR it names.

**Write-order rule.** The record names the candidate commit it covers.
Committing the record moves `HEAD`, so the record is written and committed
**last**, and the check is then run with `--candidate` set to the commit the
record names — the tip of the substantive work, not the record commit itself.
The push range therefore carries one extra commit that touches only this file
and no governed path.

**Known limitation (v1), stated deliberately.** A record whose section names
candidate commit X is invisible to a run against candidate commit Y even when
X is an ancestor of Y and nothing governed changed in between. That is
deliberate — it is the property that makes a stale record fail — and
widening it to accept a proven-clean ancestor span is the obvious v2, not
something to do here without review.
